## About Flowbite
Current [flowbite v2.2.1 css](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flowbite/2.2.1/flowbite.min.js) seems to be tailwindcss v3.3.5 but as a css file instead of a JS as you are welcome to use it from [the tailwindcss quick start](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn).  
So here we just do not use [flowbite v2.2.1 css](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flowbite/2.2.1/flowbite.min.js) but instead we use [tailwindcss v3.3.5](https://cdn.tailwindcss.com/3.4.1) JS file.

And we use [flowbite v2.2.1 JS file](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flowbite/2.2.1/flowbite.min.js) to get their component bindings like the Modal for example.
